  안녕하세요. 백엔드 개발자입니다.
  새로운 것에 대해 흥미를 느끼고 학습하는 것을 즐기고 있습니다. 자신에게 핑계대지 않기 위해 개인/그룹으로 스터디도 꾸준히 진행하며 <mark>끊임없이 학습</mark>하고 있습니다.

  현재는 이커머스 서비스의 전반적인 기능, 관리자, 배치를 담당하고 있습니다.
  서비스를 탄탄하게 운영하는 포인트에 집중을 많이 하는 편입니다. 단편적인 예로 모니터링과 테스트 코드에 대해 매우 중요하게 생각하고 있습니다.

  협업에 대해서 매우 중요하게 생각하고 있습니다.
  개인보단 팀 단위로 생각하고 학습한 내용을 공유하며 <mark>함께 성장하는 분위기</mark>를 만드려고 노력하고 있습니다.

  모든 사람에게서는 배울 점이 있다고 생각합니다.
  연차, 나이, 직군, 파트 모두 떠나서 배울 점이 있다고 생각하고 항상 부족하다고 생각합니다. <mark>늘 겸손하자</mark>가 저의 가치관입니다.

          I started this project as a way if learning <mark>React</mark> and it has since grown into a fully fledged app. I have learned many skills through this and been I'm very proud of having this in my portfolio. If you don't have a project as awesome as this I would advise you make one.

            Every company needs its networks properly administered and The Boring Compay is no exception. Digging holes is hard and I play my part making sure the whole company stays connected. I lead a team of 5 people and enjoy driving the company to try new technologies.

          During my time at Harvard I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

          I spent a lot of my free time as a committee member of the *Harvard Mountaineering Club* taking on roles such as *Trip Secretary* and *Vice-President*.
